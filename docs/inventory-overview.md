Inventory overview
==================

<a href="#" class="wedocs-print-article wedocs-hide-print wedocs-hide-mobile" title="Print this article"><em></em></a>

<span style="color: #000000;">The default Inventory contains two
folders: **Materials** and **Methods**.</span>

These are used to organise respectively samples and materials of any
type and lab protocols.

<span style="color: #000000;">Samples, materials and protocols are
modelled in openBIS as *Objects*. In the openBIS ELN-LIMS for life
sciences, the following Object types are preconfigured in the
database:</span>

 

    Antibodies, Chemicals, Enzymes, Media, Solutions and Buffers, Plasmids, Plants, Oligos, 
    RNAs, Bacteria, Cell lines, Flies, Yeasts, General protocols, PCR protocols, Western blotting protocols.

 

<span style="color: #000000;">These *Objects* are organised in
*Collections* in the **Materials** and **Methods** sections of the
Inventory .</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The generic openBIS ELN-LIMS only has one
predefined *Object* type for the Inventory:</span>

 

    General Protocol 

 

<span style="color: #000000;">Additional *Object* types and the
corresponding *Collections* must be created by the *Instance admin*,
based on the needs of the lab.</span>

 

It is possible to add additional folders in the Inventory, for example
for **Equipment** (see **[Create new Inventory
Spaces](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-20-10-3/space-management/create-new-inventory-spaces/))**.
