modelled in openBIS as **Objects**. In the openBIS ELN-LIMS for life
sciences, the following Object types are preconfigured in the
database:  
  

*Antibodies, Chemicals, Enzymes, Media,
Solutions and Buffers, Plasmids, Plants, Oligos, RNAs, Bacteria, Cell
lines, Flies, Yeasts, General protocols, PCR protocols, Western blotting
protocols.*  

These **Objects** are organised in
**Collections** in the **Materials** and **Methods** sections of the
Inventory .  
  

The generic openBIS ELN-LIMS only has one
predefined Object type for the Inventory, *General Protocol*. Additional
Object types and Collections must be created by the users, based on
their needs.
