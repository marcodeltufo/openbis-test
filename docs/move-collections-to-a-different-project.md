Move Collections to a different Project
=======================================



 

It is possible to move one Collection with it entire content (Objects +
Datasets) from one Project to another.

If Objects contain parent/child relationships these are preserved.

This operation requires *Space Power User* or *Admin* rights.

 

To move Collections in the Inventory:

1.  Go to the Collection page you want to move
2.  Click on **Edit Collection**

4\. Enter the code of the Project where you want to move your
Collection. If you start typing the code, openBIS will prompt you with a
list of available options and you can select the appropriate one from
there.
